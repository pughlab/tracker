## This is a model for how to deploy the tracker with an
## nginx reverse proxy. This means that the tracker itself
## can be run using a less-privileged user, and even updated
## without needing to mess around with port 80.
##
## This is also recommended for SSL. If you want to use SSL,
## it is definitely best to use a highly maintained system, 
## and preferably not Java, to interface to SSL and proxy 
## internally.
##
## There are probably performance improvements we can make
## too with a little caching.
